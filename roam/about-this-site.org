#+TITLE: About This Site

Let me explain the context a bit more. I am new to Haskell, and decided to learn
more about it while porting my website from nanoc to ema. Besides learning for
fun, my motivation in moving to Haskell has been the ability to interact with
and transform the Pandoc data in ways that would let me do stuff like
zettelkastens with org-roam.

One thing that I do in my website is automatically compiling LaTeX figures (e.g.
tikz) and inlining them in the resulting html. This was simple to reimplement
and is working file, the compilation happens when building the model ðŸ™‚.

But now my issue: since compiling with LaTeX takes such a long time, it gets
impractical to do it every time the file changes. In nanoc I worked around this
by hashing the figures' source text and saving the resulting images named by
their hash. Before compiling it again, the script would look for a file with the
same hash and use it instead. This works but I thought I could do this sort of
caching better and in more generality with Ema.
