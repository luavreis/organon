Our chronology ends around 2000, with just a taste of later developments such as open-closed topological string theory, the categorification of quantum groups, Khovanov homology, and Lurie's work on the classification of topological quantum field theories.},

  abstract = {We propose a unified mathematical framework for classifying phases of matter. The framework is based on different types of combinatorial structures with a notion of locality called lattices. A tensor lattice is a local prescription that associates tensor networks to those lattices. Different lattices are related by local operations called moves. Those local operations define consistency conditions for the tensors of the tensor network, the solutions to which yield exactly solvable models for all kinds of phases. We implement the framework to obtain models for symmetry-breaking and topological phases in up to three space-time dimensions, their boundaries, defects, domain walls and symmetries, as well as their anyons for 2+1-dimensional systems. We also deliver ideas of how other kinds of phases, like SPT/SET, fermionic, free-fermionic, chiral, and critical phases, can be described within our framework. We also define another structure called contracted tensor lattices which generalize tensor lattices: The former associate tensors instead of tensor networks to lattices, and the consistency conditions for those tensors are defined by another kind of local operation called gluings. Using this generalization, our framework also covers mathematical structures like axiomatic (non-fully extended or defective) TQFTs, that do not directly describe phases on a microscopic physical level, but formalize certain aspects of potential phases, like the anyon statistics of 2+1-dimensional phases. We also introduce the very powerful concept of (contracted) tensor lattice mapping, unifying a lots of different operations, such as stacking, anyon fusion, anyon condensation, equivalence of different fixed point models, taking the Drinfel'd centre, trivial defects or interpreting a bosonic model as a fermionic model.},

  abstract = {Reducing the number of non-Clifford quantum gates present in a circuit is an important task for efficiently implementing quantum computations, especially in the fault-tolerant regime. We present a new method for reducing the number of T-gates in a quantum circuit based on the ZX-calculus, which matches or beats previous approaches to T-count reduction on the majority of our benchmark circuits in the ancilla-free case, in some cases yielding up to 50\% improvement. Our method begins by representing the quantum circuit as a ZX-diagram, a tensor network-like structure that can be transformed and simplified according to the rules of the ZX-calculus. We then show that a recently-proposed simplification strategy can be extended to reduce T-count using a new technique called phase teleportation. This technique allows nonClifford phases to combine and cancel by propagating non-locally through a generic quantum circuit. Phase teleportation does not change the number or location of non-phase gates and the method also applies to arbitrary non-Clifford phase gates as well as gates with unknown phase parameters in parametrised circuits. Furthermore, the simplification strategy we use is powerful enough to validate equality of many circuits. In particular, we use it to show that our optimised circuits are indeed equal to the original ones. We have implemented the routines of this paper in the open-source library PyZX.},

  abstract = {We describe a graphical calculus for completely positive maps and in doing so review the theory of open quantum systems and other fundamental primitives of quantum information theory using the language of tensor networks. In particular we demonstrate the construction of tensor networks to pictographically represent the Liouville-superoperator, Choi-matrix, process-matrix, Kraus, and system-environment representations for the evolution of quantum states, review how these representations interrelate, and illustrate how graphical manipulations of the tensor networks may be used to concisely transform between them. To further demonstrate the utility of the presented graphical calculus we include several examples where we provide arguably simpler graphical proofs of several useful quantities in quantum information theory including the composition and contraction of multipartite channels, a condition for whether an arbitrary bipartite state may be used for ancilla assisted process tomography, and the derivation of expressions for the average gate fidelity and entanglement fidelity of a channel in terms of each of the different representations of the channel.},
